TODO:
    - explicit access of length and data pointers for arrays / strings
        - question: should we be able to assign to these things?
            - answer: probably yes

    - short-circuit 'and' and 'or'

    - 'malloc' implementation for interpreter. Can use real malloc and then just convert the offset based on where our stack begins

    - default types (especially for structs / fn params)
        -- p: i32; -- should default to 0
        -- p: struct{x := 9, y := 10}; -- p.x should be 9, p.y should be 10
        -- p: struct{x := 9, y := 10} = {x: 5}; -- should pass type checking, p.x should be 5, p.y should be 10
        -- f: fn(x: i32 = 3) k ret x; }; ret f(); -- should pass type checking, return value should be 3

    - better interpreter debugging
        - more accurate source information
        - get list of stack variables and print their values by name

    - llvm debugging info

    - enum / tagged union

    - real implementation for 'Any' and 'Type'

    - array bounds checking

    - conversion (like a cast but does actual work)

    - passing stack variables to polymorphic procedures?
        - first, is this even a good thing to allow?
        - implementation should just be to convert the pointer to the relative offset for the new function
